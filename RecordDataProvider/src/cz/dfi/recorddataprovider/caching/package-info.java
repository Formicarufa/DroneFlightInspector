 * A simple caching mechanism used when a component wants to 
 * save some information for each opened recording.
 * The class that wants to use the data has to implement {@link CachedDataReceiver } interface.
 * <p>
 * This is an alternative approach to the option to put the cache into the lookup
 * of each file.
