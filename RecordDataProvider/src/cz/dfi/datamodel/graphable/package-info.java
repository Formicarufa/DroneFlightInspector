/**
 * Contains the important {@link DoubleQuantity} class.
 * Use Double Quantity for a quantity that is not used in special context,
 * but should be displayed in the values tree, available for graphing and other general actions.
 * To create a quantity that can be graphed ( = its values can be converted to doubles) 
 * but is itself not a Double Quantity, you can subclass the {@link GraphableQuantity} interface.
