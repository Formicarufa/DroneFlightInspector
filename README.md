# DroneFlightInspector
<p>The Drone Flight Inspector is an application for viewing and analysis of data recorded during a flight of a drone. </p>
<p>The application is written in Java and is based on the 

<a href="https://netbeans.org/features/platform/">Netbeans Platform</a>. </p>
<p>Currently, it is possible to open recordings of 
<a href="http://www.parrot.com/usa/products/ardrone-2/">AR.Drone2</a> flights which were recorded either from ROS 
(<a href="https://github.com/AutonomyLab/ardrone_autonomy">ardrone_autonomy</a> project) or 
using 
<a href="https://github.com/Formicarufa/YADrone-Recorder">yaDrone-Recorder</a> 
(which is my fork of the 
<a href="https://vsis-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/oldServer/teaching//projects/yadrone/">yaDrone</a>
framework). </p>
